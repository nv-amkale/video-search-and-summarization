# Pin Docker CE + plugins + containerd.io to a known-good combination, but
# ONLY when the host's Docker is outside the tested range. Some Brev
# launchables ship a newer Docker than the VSS deploy profiles are tested
# against; pin explicitly so compose/buildx incompatibilities don't surface
# mid-deployment.
#
# When the installed Docker already falls in [28.3.3, 29.5.0) the version
# downgrade is skipped: re-pinning to an exact epoch-versioned package that
# the platform's apt repo may not carry (e.g. DGX Spark / DGX-OS on arm64)
# fails with "version not found" for no benefit. The in-range packages are
# still held so the box can't drift past the tested range.
#
# It also sets the cgroupfs cgroup driver the deploy requires, since that is
# the other daemon-level change a host needs before bring-up and it costs the
# same dockerd restart.
#
# Run this BEFORE anything the host is meant to keep running: a docker-ce
# downgrade restarts dockerd, which disrupts live containers.
#
# Idempotent -- safe to re-run.
