"""Inventory the third-party dependencies that live in no language manifest.

``osrb_scan`` walks lockfiles and requirements files, so it sees the PyPI and
npm closure and nothing else. Everything a container drags in — the base image,
the apt/apk package list, a ``git clone`` of upstream source, a Helm subchart, a
pinned GitHub Action — is invisible to it. That blind spot is not theoretical:
the audit that motivated this module found AGPL-3.0 (grafana, minio),
Elastic-2.0 (elasticsearch, kibana, logstash), Confluent Community (cp-kafka)
and the GPL-2.0-or-later codec set (libx264, libx265, libxvidcore, liba52,
libdca) reaching OSRB through exactly these files, none of which any lockfile
mentions. This module reads them.

Six parsers, one per evidence shape, each returning ``osrb_scan.make_row``
rows:

    parse_dockerfile        FROM images, COPY --from external images, OS package
                            installs, pip installs, and fetched source/binaries
    parse_compose           service images that are pulled rather than built
    parse_helm_chart        the Chart.yaml dependencies list
    parse_cmake             find_package / FetchContent / ExternalProject /
                            pkg_check_modules
    parse_precommit         .pre-commit-config.yaml repos, pinned by rev
    parse_actions_workflow  uses: owner/repo@ref in .github/workflows

Licenses are deliberately NOT guessed. There is no offline mapping from
``libx264`` or ``confluentinc/cp-kafka`` to an SPDX id that is right often
enough to be trusted, and a row that claims MIT when the truth is GPL-2.0 is
worse than a row that admits it does not know: the first ends the review, the
second starts one. Every row here therefore carries an empty license and
``risk=Unknown`` (via ``license_risk("")``) unless the file itself states a
license. A hardcoded lookup table would go stale silently, which is the class
of failure this whole change exists to remove.

YAML is read with a narrow, indentation-aware line reader rather than PyYAML,
because CI runs these scripts on a bare ``setup-python`` with no ``pip
install``; importing PyYAML would make the compliance gate fail closed on
every PR. The reader only understands the handful of keys named above.

Diff integration: ``inventory_at_ref`` returns ``{key: row}`` keyed by
``(source_kind, language, package, new_version)``. Comparing the key sets of
two refs yields added/removed; grouping by ``key[:3]`` (everything but the
version) yields updated, which is the same shape ``osrb_scan.diff_language``
already uses for lockfile packages.
