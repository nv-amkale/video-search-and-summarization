# VSS CLI memory policy

Elasticsearch is the authoritative structured VSS memory store. OpenClaw
Markdown notes are an optional compact cache for agent recall; OpenClaw
`memory-core` owns their indexing, retrieval, consolidation, and promotion.

## Configure static policy once

Use `vss configure memory`, not `vss memory configure`:

```console
vss configure memory \
  --enable \
  --backend elasticsearch \
  --index vss-memory \
  --persist-by-default
```

This stores infrastructure, sink selection, and default policy in
`~/.vss/config.json`. Existing deployment services remain intact.

`memory.enabled` controls whether memory read/write commands can access the
store. `memory.persist_by_default` independently controls whether search and
summarize runs persist automatically. Memory can remain enabled for recall
while automatic persistence is disabled.

Inspect or validate the effective policy without changing records:

```console
vss configure memory show
vss configure memory check
```

Configure introspection separately. This is explicit static configuration: VSS
does not discover a judge endpoint, model, or credential automatically.

For an OpenClaw Gateway:

```console
openclaw config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
# Restart the gateway after changing its HTTP endpoint configuration.
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN='<gateway-token>'

vss configure memory introspection \
  --judge-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1 \
  --judge-model openclaw/default \
  --judge-api-key-env OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
```

`--judge-api-key-env` stores only the environment-variable name. The variable
must contain the Bearer token whenever `vss memory introspect` runs. The token
is never written to `~/.vss/config.json` or displayed by `memory show`.

`openclaw/default` delegates model selection to OpenClaw. To request one
specific OpenClaw backend, add `--judge-backend-model <provider/model>`; VSS
sends that value as `x-openclaw-model`. For any other OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions service, set its base `/v1` URL and API-facing model explicitly:

```console
vss configure memory introspection \
  --judge-endpoint https://llm.example.com/v1 \
  --judge-model llama-3.3-70b-instruct \
  --judge-api-key-env CUSTOM_LLM_API_KEY
```

Set sufficiency criteria inline or from a UTF-8 file:

```console
vss configure memory introspection --judge-criteria "Require direct evidence for every material claim."
vss configure memory introspection --judge-criteria-file ./introspection-criteria.txt
```

Updates preserve unspecified values. Use `--clear-judge-api-key-env` or
`--clear-judge-backend-model` to remove those optional settings.
`vss configure memory show` and `check` never run introspection or call the
judge (`check` still validates the configured memory backend).

Backend and index selection are not normal per-request flags. Search,
summarize, status, get, list, and `vss memory` do not expose
`--memory-index`. Job-producing commands do not expose a positive `--persist`
flag. Use `--no-persist` as the safe per-request opt-out.

## Access structured memory

`vss memory` is the data-access surface:

```console
vss memory upsert
vss memory get --job-id <job-id>
vss memory query --job-id <job-id>
vss memory events --asset-id <sensor-or-video-id>
vss memory introspect --query "What happened?" --sensor <sensor-name>
vss memory embeddings backfill --dry-run
```

Use `get` for an exact parent or child identity, `query` for filtered or text
recall, `events` for temporal child-record recall, and `upsert` for explicit
record writes. Identity, status, sensor, time-window, text, and result-limit
flags remain dynamic.

Memory records use the human-readable VIOS sensor name in
`input.sensors[].id`; internal sensor UUIDs, stream IDs, and video IDs remain
under `input.sensors[].info`. Sensor filters also match older records that
stored the readable name as `input.sensors[].info.name`. Text queries rank by
relevance before recency, while queries without text remain newest-first.

`memory introspect` performs bounded, memory-first question answering and emits
exactly one JSON object to stdout (compact by default, indented with `--pretty`).
That object includes the sufficiency decision (`sufficient`, `reason`,
`evidence_record_ids`, and identified `gaps`), each VLM follow-up (`question`,
`answer`, `model`, `num_frames`, window, and timeout), memory citations, the
synthesized `answer`, and any `unresolved_gaps` left after inspection.
The query must be scoped by `--sensor`, `--job-id`, or a complete
`--start-time`/`--end-time` range. A child lookup requires its full public
identity: `--job-id`, `--record-type`, and `--record-id`. Time bounds accept
ISO-8601 UTC instants only.
`--record-type event|search_hit|incident` and `--group summary|search|alert`
refine a useful scope but do not establish one by themselves.

One workflow retrieves at most 10 records, requests at most 3 VLM follow-ups,
and has a 180-second overall timeout. Follow-up windows have no
introspection-specific duration limit; VIOS and RT-VLM apply their normal media
limits. Pass `--fps` to control temporal sampling density. When the follow-up
window duration is known, `fps × seconds` is capped at 60 frames so a long
inspect window cannot flood the vision token budget. The introspection
request/result is never stored and never creates a Markdown note.
The configured OpenAI-compatible text LLM performs both memory-sufficiency
judgment and final answer synthesis. RT-VLM is not used as a judge or
synthesizer. It is used only for grounded visual follow-ups when the text judge
identifies a missing sensor/time window. Each follow-up uses the normal
`vss vlm run` execution path, follows the configured static persistence policy,
and remains independently visible through VLM job reads when persistence is
enabled.

Accepted job groups are `summary`, `search`, `alert`, and `vlm`. `media` is
not a job group because VIOS does not mint job IDs or memory completion
records.

There is no `lookup` or `retrieve` command. The schema has no slug or
`memory_id`. `events --window` is deferred until duration and boundary
semantics are defined; use `--start-time` and `--end-time`.

## Derived embeddings and hybrid recall

The canonical `nv.vss.memory/1.0` documents in Elasticsearch stay
authoritative. Vectors live in a separate versioned companion index. An
authoritative record gains only `output.embedding` references — companion
index, document id, model, dimensions, and content hash — never vector values.
Markdown notes are untouched by this: they carry no vectors and no embedding
references.

### Default: reuse the OpenClaw Gateway

VSS does not start OpenClaw, install an embedding model, or load model weights.
The [OpenClaw Gateway](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/docs/gateway/index.md)
must already be running, and its OpenAI-compatible HTTP surface must be enabled.
The current OpenClaw prerequisite is:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "http": {
      "endpoints": {
        "chatCompletions": {
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Export the Gateway bearer token by name; never put its value in VSS
configuration or a command-line endpoint:

```bash
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="<gateway token>"
```

Smoke-test the Gateway before configuring VSS:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openclaw/default",
    "input": ["VSS embedding readiness probe"]
  }'
```

Then enable semantic memory with the default profile:

```console
vss configure memory --embeddings
```

This resolves to:

```text
provider: openclaw_gateway
endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1
model: openclaw/default
api_key_env: OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
```

`openclaw/default` is an OpenClaw agent target, not a raw model identifier.
OpenClaw chooses the embedding provider and model configured for that agent.
VSS receives vectors over HTTP and stores them, but never downloads or imports
the model runtime.

If dimensions are omitted, configuration sends one probe and records the
returned vector length. `--embedding-dimensions INTEGER` sets an expected
length explicitly and permits offline configuration; the live check and every
later response still validate it. The default companion index is
`vss-memory-embeddings-v1`.

### Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints

A custom endpoint and model must be explicit:

```console
vss configure memory \
  --embeddings \
  --embedding-provider openai_compatible \
  --embedding-endpoint https://embedding.example.com/v1 \
  --embedding-model example-embedding-model \
  --embedding-api-key-env EXAMPLE_EMBEDDING_TOKEN
```

Authentication is optional for a trusted local endpoint:

```console
vss configure memory \
  --embeddings \
  --embedding-provider openai_compatible \
  --embedding-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9000/v1 \
  --embedding-model local-custom-model \
  --no-embedding-auth
```

Only OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` is supported. VSS sends only `model`
and `input` by default. Use `--embedding-query-input-type` and
`--embedding-document-input-type` only when the custom service requires those
extensions. Expected dimensions are not sent as a request parameter.

Endpoint URLs must be absolute HTTP(S) URLs and cannot contain usernames or
passwords. `--embedding-api-key-env` stores only an environment-variable name;
VSS resolves its value at request time and never prints or persists it.
`--embedding-timeout-seconds` (30 seconds), `--embedding-batch-size` (16),
`--semantic-candidate-count` (50), and `--rrf-rank-constant` (60) complete the
static policy. The companion index must differ from authoritative memory.

Validate the wiring without writing records:

```console
vss configure memory check
```

With embeddings enabled this also embeds one probe string, reports the
configured target, any resolved model identity returned by the endpoint, and
the vector dimensions. It distinguishes missing credentials, authentication
failures, endpoint failures, malformed responses, and dimension mismatches
without exposing a token. A missing companion index is created lazily on the
first embedding write or backfill.

Retrieval mode applies only to text queries:

```console
vss memory query --query "forklift near the loading dock" --mode hybrid
```

`hybrid` — the default whenever embeddings are enabled — runs the keyword BM25
match over `input.query` and `output.answer` and a filtered kNN search over the
companion index, then fuses the two rankings client-side with reciprocal rank
fusion. `semantic` uses the vector ranking alone. `keyword` embeds nothing.

Identity lookups stay deterministic. `get`, `events`, and any `query` without
`--query` read Elasticsearch directly and embed nothing, as does a
`memory introspect` scoped by `--job-id` or `--record-id`: identity selects the
evidence, so the question is never embedded and never filters it. An
introspection scoped by `--sensor` or a time window sends its question through
the configured retrieval mode.

Recall degrades rather than fails under the existing retrieval contract.
`--mode semantic` or `--mode hybrid` with embeddings disabled warns on stderr
and answers from keyword retrieval. A provider or companion-index failure
during a query also falls back to keyword retrieval and emits a diagnostic that
the semantic leg was unavailable; it does not present the result as successful
semantic retrieval. Backend details and credentials are not logged.

Records written before embeddings were enabled are indexed by a backfill:

```console
vss memory embeddings backfill --dry-run
vss memory embeddings backfill --batch-size 16 --limit 500
```

It scans authoritative memory in bounded batches and emits one JSON object
counting `scanned`, `eligible`, `embedded`, `reused`, `skipped`, and `failed`,
with per-record `failures`. `--dry-run` reports eligibility without provider
calls or writes. Any failure exits 6 with those counts still on stdout. Only
`completed` and `partial` records with searchable content are eligible, and
re-running is cheap: an unchanged record keeps its vector when the model and
dimensions still match.

The companion mapping binds the index to the VSS embedding schema, provider
profile, configured model target, expected dimensions, canonical searchable
text version, cosine similarity, and a credential-free hash of the endpoint.
Changing any part of that vector-space identity is not an in-place edit. Point
`--embedding-index` at a fresh versioned index and run:

```console
vss memory embeddings backfill
```

VSS never deletes or recreates an incompatible index. OpenClaw may change the
provider behind `openclaw/default` without changing the target string. A
same-dimension change hidden behind that alias cannot always be detected.
After changing OpenClaw's embedding provider or model, rerun
`vss configure memory --embeddings` with a fresh `--embedding-index`, then
backfill it.

## Optional OpenClaw Markdown cache

Enable the capability and choose its default once:

```console
vss configure memory \
  --markdown \
  --harness openclaw \
  --workspace /absolute/path/to/openclaw/workspace \
  --write-notes-by-default
```

Notes are written only after the authoritative Elasticsearch parent succeeds,
under:

```text
memory/YYYY-MM-DD-vss.md
```

VSS never writes `MEMORY.md`, `DREAMS.md`, or session files. Each bounded
block has a job marker, so rewriting the same job replaces its block.

Use `--write-memory-note` or `--no-write-memory-note` on one search or
summarize run to override the configured note default. These flags never
enable Elasticsearch persistence. Explicit note writing with `--no-persist`,
with static persistence disabled, or without a configured Markdown sink is
rejected.

The completion marker's `persisted` field always describes authoritative
Elasticsearch persistence. Markdown status is reported separately as
`memory_note`.

## Scope

This surface preserves parent/child persistence and recall. Introspection adds
bounded sufficiency analysis and VLM follow-ups without storing an
introspection trace. Semantic and hybrid recall are derived from the companion
vector index and never change what the authoritative store holds. Graph memory
is not included.

Trusted persistence callbacks are not supported. No active code or tests
require them, and arbitrary callback execution is not exposed to agents.
