"""The command-group base class: the framework owns the verbs.

Every group answers the same four verbs (SDD §3.1)::

    vss <group> run       synchronous; returns only when the result is final
    vss <group> status    reconcile a record memory still marks pending
    vss <group> get       fetch a completed record by job_id
    vss <group> list      recent jobs, including in-flight

A group implements exactly one of them. §6.2 makes ``status``/``get``/``list``
pure reads against the memory index -- "get on a completed job, list, and
terminal status never touch a backend" -- so a group has nothing to contribute
to them and inherits the framework's. That is the whole reason this is an ABC
rather than the Protocol it replaces: a Protocol can state a shape, but it
cannot hand down an implementation.

The cost is that a plugin now imports ``vss_cli``, so plugin and CLI can skew.
:data:`API_VERSION` is the guard, checked at load time by
:func:`vss_cli.plugins.load`.

There is deliberately no ``submit`` verb. Fire-and-forget belongs to the
harness (UM-4, Hook 1A): it backgrounds ``run`` and ``notifyOnExit`` delivers
the completion marker. A ``submit`` verb would push the harness back into
model-driven polling, which is the pattern the hook design exists to remove.
