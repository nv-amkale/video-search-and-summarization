## Purpose

Operate the VSS alert pipeline (mode detection, Alert-Bridge subscriptions, verification verdicts, on-demand verification, always-on operation, Slack notifications, queries, camera onboarding, verifier-prompt customization).

## Prerequisites

- Active VSS **alerts** profile reachable either on Docker (`$HOST_IP:9080` Alert
  Bridge) or through the public Ingress (`VSS_PUBLIC_URL` with `/alert-bridge`).
- Follow
  [`../vss-build-vision-ai/references/deployment_resolution.md`](../../vss-build-vision-ai/references/deployment_resolution.md)
  for the shared `VSS_PUBLIC_URL` contract.
- `curl` and `jq` on the agent host. Docker Compose mode detection may use
  `docker` / `generated.env`; Kubernetes must not.

## Instructions

Follow the routing tables and step-by-step workflows below. Each section that ends in *workflow*, *quick start*, or *flow* is intended to be executed top-to-bottom. Detailed reference material lives in `references/` and helper scripts live in `scripts/` — call them via `run_script` when the skill points to a script by name.

## Examples

Runnable end-to-end scenarios live under `evals/` (each `*.json` manifest); inline `curl` blocks appear in each workflow below. Replay with `nv-base validate <this-skill-dir> --agent-eval`.

## Limitations

Requires the matching VSS profile/microservice deployed and reachable. NGC-hosted models/NIMs are subject to rate-limits, GPU-memory needs, and license terms; concurrency and storage limits depend on host hardware and the profile's compose file.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused** → microservice not running: probe `/docs` or `/health`, redeploy via `vss-build-vision-ai`.
- **HTTP 401/403 on NGC pulls** → missing/expired `NGC_CLI_API_KEY`: `docker login nvcr.io` and re-export the key.
- **OOM / model load failure** → insufficient GPU memory: use a smaller variant or `docker compose down` to free GPUs.

# VSS Alert Management

The alerts profile runs in one of two modes (chosen at the `/vss-build-vision-ai` stock Alerts workflow in verification or real-time mode) — see **The Two Modes** table below. This skill routes by **deployed mode + user intent** (monitoring vs subscription CRUD vs Slack webhook), driving the **Alert Bridge REST API directly** (no VSS Agent `/generate`).

## When to Use

- Start/stop a real-time alert on a sensor ("Start real-time alert for boxes dropped on warehouse_sample")
- Create/list/stop realtime subscription rules on Alert Bridge
- Set up or manage Slack incident notifications
- List or query detected incidents / alerts (Workflow C)
- Inspect CV verification results and verdicts (confirmed/rejected/not-confirmed/verification-failed), explain how verification works, customize VLM-verifier prompts (CV mode — Workflow B)
- Run a one-shot on-demand verification of a specific video/image URL (CV mode — Workflow F)
- Check whether always-on alerting is active, query its incidents, troubleshoot missing always-on alerts (VLM real-time — Workflow G; operate only, no config authoring)
- Add a new camera to the alerts pipeline (Workflow A)

---

## Deployment prerequisite

Requires the VSS **alerts** profile in either `verification` (CV) or `real-time`
(VLM) mode. Resolve endpoints once before probing. See
[`../vss-build-vision-ai/references/deployment_resolution.md`](../../vss-build-vision-ai/references/deployment_resolution.md).

```bash
# Prefer VSS_PUBLIC_URL; accept legacy VSS_ENDPOINT as the same public origin.
if [ -z "${VSS_PUBLIC_URL:-}" ] && [ -n "${VSS_ENDPOINT:-}" ]; then
  VSS_PUBLIC_URL="${VSS_ENDPOINT}"
fi

if [ -n "${VSS_PUBLIC_URL:-}" ]; then
  DEPLOYMENT_KIND="kubernetes"
  VSS_PUBLIC_URL="${VSS_PUBLIC_URL%/}"
  # Force public prefixes — ignore leftover Docker AB / VST / VA_MCP host ports.
  AB="${VSS_PUBLIC_URL}/alert-bridge"
  VA_MCP_URL="${VSS_PUBLIC_URL}/va-mcp"
else
  DEPLOYMENT_KIND="docker"
  : "${HOST_IP:?Set HOST_IP for Docker Compose or VSS_PUBLIC_URL for Kubernetes}"
  AB="http://${HOST_IP}:9080"
  VA_MCP_URL="http://${HOST_IP}:9901"
fi
```

On Kubernetes, do not use `kubectl port-forward`, Service DNS, NodePorts,
`docker exec`, `docker inspect`, or `docker ps`. Probe Alert Bridge with
`curl -sf --max-time 5 "$AB/health"` (`/health`, not `/api/v1/health`).

```bash
# Reachability — either mode. Alert Bridge must answer before operate work.
curl -sf --max-time 5 "$AB/health" >/dev/null
```

Optional Docker-only peer check (skipped on Kubernetes — RT-VLM is not on
alerts Ingress):

```bash
if [ "${DEPLOYMENT_KIND:-docker}" != "kubernetes" ]; then
  curl -sf --max-time 5 "http://${HOST_IP}:8000/docs" >/dev/null \
    && docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' \
       | grep -qE '^(vss-rtvi-cv|vss-rtvi-vlm)$'
fi
```

If the Alert Bridge probe fails, ask which mode to deploy and hand off to
`the `/vss-build-vision-ai` stock Alerts workflow in the matching mode` (decline → stop; pre-authorized
autonomous deploy → run directly with `verification` by default). If it
passes, detect the mode per Step 1.

---

## The Two Modes (Deploy-Time Choice)

| Mode | Deploy flag | Env (`.env`) | What runs | What is available |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CV (verification)** | `-m verification` | `MODE=2d_cv` | RT-CV (Grounding DINO) + Behavior Analytics + `alert-bridge` VLM verifier + **`rtvi-vlm`** | Static CV pipeline (**Workflow A**) + verification results & verdicts (**Workflow B**) + on-demand verification (**Workflow F**). VIOS webhooks register streams with RT-CV. Realtime rule CRUD (**D**) and Slack (**E**) are gated to real-time mode (skill refuses on CV). |
| **VLM (real-time)** | `-m real-time` | `MODE=2d_vlm` | `alert-bridge` + `rtvi-vlm` | Dynamic VLM real-time alerts (**Workflow D**), Slack (**E**), incident queries (**C**), and always-on operation (**Workflow G** — `ALERT_AGENT_ALWAYS_ON=true` / `alert_agent.always_on: true` when deployed with `-m real-time`). No static CV pipeline. |

**Switching modes** uses the `vss-build-vision-ai` teardown + deploy flow, asking for the other mode. Both modes use the same agent `config.yml`; VIOS webhooks follow `notification_config_${MODE}.json`. `rtvi-vlm` runs in both modes.

**`RTVI_VLM_KAFKA_ENABLED` is mode-specific.** `overrides.env` ships `RTVI_VLM_KAFKA_ENABLED=false` for verification (`2d_cv`), where nothing consumes RT-VLM's Kafka output and leaving it on makes RT-VLM publish duplicate incidents that Logstash indexes under `mdx-vlm-incidents-1970-01-01`. Real-time (`2d_vlm`) alerts depend on RT-VLM publishing to Kafka, so the line must be commented out in that mode — `dev-profile.sh` does this automatically for `-m real-time`. If a real-time deployment produces no alerts, check that this override is not still active in `generated.env`.

---

## Step 1 — Detect the Currently Deployed Mode

Before running any alert workflow, check which mode is live.

**Kubernetes** — do not use `docker ps`. Prefer an explicit mode hint, then ask:

```bash
# Operator / deploy hint (preferred on Kubernetes).
# ALERTS_MODE=real-time|verification  or  MODE=2d_vlm|2d_cv
if [ -n "${ALERTS_MODE:-}" ]; then
  case "${ALERTS_MODE}" in
    real-time|realtime|vlm|2d_vlm) echo "mode=VLM" ;;
    verification|cv|2d_cv) echo "mode=CV" ;;
  esac
elif [ "${MODE:-}" = "2d_vlm" ]; then echo "mode=VLM"
elif [ "${MODE:-}" = "2d_cv" ]; then echo "mode=CV"
elif [ "${DEPLOYMENT_KIND:-docker}" = "kubernetes" ]; then
  # Docs walkthrough is real-time; ask rather than guessing from private pods.
  echo "Ask the user: is this alerts deployment real-time (VLM) or verification (CV)?"
fi
```

**Docker only** — use CV-only containers as the signal (`vss-rtvi-vlm` runs in
both modes, so it is **not** a reliable mode signal alone):

```bash
if [ "${DEPLOYMENT_KIND:-docker}" != "kubernetes" ]; then
  # CV verification mode (vss-behavior-analytics + vss-rtvi-cv are CV-only)
  if docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep -qx vss-behavior-analytics; then
    echo "mode=CV"
  # VLM real-time mode has no CV pipeline; vss-rtvi-vlm runs in both modes.
  elif docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep -qx vss-rtvi-vlm; then
    echo "mode=VLM"
  fi
fi
```

If `vss-behavior-analytics` is present → **CV mode** (which also has `vss-rtvi-vlm`).
If only `vss-rtvi-vlm` is present (and no CV pipeline) → **VLM mode**.
If neither matches on Docker, the alerts profile is not deployed — direct the user to the `vss-build-vision-ai` skill.

Alternative Docker signal (preferred when `docker ps` isn't accessible): check the deployed `generated.env`, falling back to `overrides.env` before a deployment has generated one:

```bash
if [ "${DEPLOYMENT_KIND:-docker}" != "kubernetes" ]; then
  ENV_FILE=deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-alerts/generated.env
  [ -f "$ENV_FILE" ] || ENV_FILE=deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-alerts/overrides.env
  grep -E '^MODE=' "$ENV_FILE"
  # MODE=2d_cv   → CV mode (full superset)
  # MODE=2d_vlm  → VLM real-time mode (vss-rtvi-vlm only; no vss-rtvi-cv)
fi
```

---

## Step 2 — Route by Deployed Mode

| Deployed mode | User asks about… | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **VLM real-time** | Slack webhook setup/status/test/stop | **Workflow E** — `references/alert-notify.md` |
| **VLM real-time** | always-on status ("is always-on active?"), always-on incidents, "why aren't always-on alerts appearing?" | **Workflow G** — `references/always-on.md` (operate only; config authoring is out of scope) |
| **CV verification** | always-on operation | Refuse — always-on rides the realtime rule engine; canonical refusal text below |
| **VLM real-time** | rule CRUD, or start/stop a realtime alert on a sensor (with **or without** a detection condition — no condition → default prompt), or stop/delete a named alert (by `alert_type`/condition or rule ID) | **Workflow D** — `references/alert-subscriptions.md` (incl. two-step stop/confirm) |
| **CV verification** | subscription/rule CRUD or Slack/notification setup | Refuse — see canonical refusal text below |
| **CV or VLM** | incident lookup / *what happened* (recent alerts, time-range, casual "any alerts today?") | **Workflow C (Query)** — works on both; **always run the query, never answer from memory** |
| **CV** | verification results / verdicts ("was it confirmed?", "show verification results"), *how does verification work*, verifier-prompt customization | **Workflow B (Verification)** — `references/verification.md`. **But** a verdict/result **follow-up to an on-demand verification just run** ("was it confirmed?", "what was the result?") → stay in **Workflow F**: poll `/realtime/incidents` by the `correlationId` (that result is incident-kind, not in `mdx-vlm-alerts-*`) |
| **CV** | one-shot "verify **this** clip/image" with a media URL, or the literal "on-demand" | **Workflow F (On-demand)** — `references/on-demand-verification.md` |
| **CV** | static CV alert onboarding | **Workflow A (CV)** — onboard RTSP via `vss-manage-video-io-storage`; VIOS webhook registers it with RT-CV |
| **VLM** | verification results / verdict inspection, verifier-prompt config, or on-demand verification (CV-only capabilities) | *Explain-only* asks → answer from **Workflow B/F** background, no calls needed. *Execution* asks → VLM-mode refusal text below (redeploy hint `-m verification`) |
| **VLM** | a CV / behavior-analytics / PPE-rule alert needing the static CV pipeline | **Redeployment required** — confirm first, then `the `/vss-build-vision-ai` stock Alerts workflow in verification mode` |
| **any** | video summarization, highlight reels, reports, non-alert analytics | **Out of scope** — hand off to `vss-generate-video-report` / `vss-query-analytics` (Cross-Skill Links); do **not** answer it via incidents or rules, even when incidents are empty |

**Always confirm before triggering a redeploy.** A mode switch stops all currently-running monitoring and restarts services.

### Intent precedence (first match wins)

1. **Workflow E (Slack)** — Slack-specific keywords (`slack`, `webhook` + `slack`, `bot token`, `slack channel`). `notify` alone is **not** sufficient.
2. **Workflow F (On-demand)** — a one-shot "verify / check / analyze **this**" pointing at a **specific media artifact** (video/image URL, clip, file), or the literal `on-demand`. Guard: *continuous monitoring of a sensor/stream* is **never** F — that's D ("watch camera X for PPE" → D; "verify this clip URL for PPE" → F).
3. **Workflow G (Always-on)** — the literal `always-on` (status, incidents, troubleshooting phrasings). Operate-not-author: status checks and queries only; never author or edit always-on rule config. A request to *create* an ordinary realtime rule is **not** G — that's D.
4. **Workflow B (Verification results)** — verification/verdict keywords (`verdict`, `confirmed?`/`rejected?`, `verification results`, "how does verification work", verifier prompt/config) **without** a media artifact to verify and without a start/stop/rule intent. Reads the `mdx-vlm-alerts-*` store (interim ES probe) and the verifier config — never the rules list. Bare "any alerts today?" is **not** B — it stays Workflow C.
5. **Workflow D (Alert rules)** — any realtime-alert request on a sensor: rule CRUD keywords (`rule`, `subscription`, rule ID), a sensor with a detection condition, a **bare start/stop with no condition** (→ default prompt), **or stopping/deleting a named alert by type/condition** ("stop the PPE alert", "delete the collision rule"). A named `alert_type`/condition = an existing **rule** → D's two-step stop protocol (`GET /api/v1/realtime` → yes/no confirm → delete).
6. **Workflow C (Query)** — incident lookup / *what happened* (`show/list incidents`, `recent alerts`, time-range queries, **and casual "any alerts…?" / "any alerts so far today?" / "what's been triggered?" phrasings**). Bare `alerts` (without `rule`/`subscription`/`active rules`) means **incidents** → Workflow C, never Workflow D.
7. **Workflow A (CV)** — CV deployment handling for anything not matched above.

> **`alerts` vs `alert rules` (C vs D) — pick exactly one, never both:**
> *what happened / has been triggered* (incidents) → **Workflow C**
> (`GET /api/v1/realtime/incidents`). *What
> rules/subscriptions are configured or active* → **Workflow D** (the
> **bare** `GET /api/v1/realtime`, no `/incidents`). Bare `alerts` =
> incidents (C); `alert rules` / `subscriptions` / `active rules` =
> inventory (D). Never answer from memory; run the one correct call —
> full endpoint detail in Workflow C below.

> **`verdicts` vs `alerts` (B vs C) — pick exactly one:** *was it
> confirmed / show verdicts / verification results* → **Workflow B**
> (interim ES probe on `mdx-vlm-alerts-*`). *What happened / any alerts
> today* → **Workflow C** (`/incidents`), even on a CV deployment.

**All start/stop requests → Workflow D.** A start with a condition uses it verbatim as the `prompt`; a bare start with no condition uses D's **default prompt** (don't ask the user for one). Any stop — bare or type-named ("stop the **PPE** alert") — resolves the rule via `GET /api/v1/realtime`, then D's two-step confirm; never `POST /generate`.

If a prompt mixes workflows ("start monitoring and send to Slack"), ask one clarifying question to split execution order.

### CV-mode refusal text for D, E, and G intents

When the deployed mode is CV verification and the user asks for an alert-subscription, always-on, or Slack/notification intent, refuse with this message verbatim:

> "Alert subscriptions, always-on operation, and Slack notifications are only supported in VLM real-time mode. Your current deployment is `<CV verification | not deployed>`. To use these features, redeploy with `the `/vss-build-vision-ai` stock Alerts workflow in real-time mode` (note: switching tears down current CV monitoring)."

No auto-redeploy. The user decides whether to switch modes.

### VLM-mode text for verification-execution intents (Workflows B and F)

Verification verdicts and on-demand verification exist only on a CV (verification) deployment. On VLM real-time, *explain-only* asks ("how does verification work?") are always answerable from Workflow B/F background — no calls, no refusal. For *execution* asks (inspect verdicts, customize verifier prompts, verify a clip on demand), reply with this message verbatim:

> "Verification workflows (verdict inspection, verifier-prompt configuration, on-demand verification) require the verification (CV) deployment. Your current deployment is VLM real-time. To use them, redeploy with `the `/vss-build-vision-ai` stock Alerts workflow in verification mode` (note: switching stops currently-running realtime monitoring)."

No auto-redeploy here either.

---

## Prereq for Either Mode: Sensor Must Be in VIOS

Both modes require the camera registered in VIOS first:

- RTSP URL / IP camera → `"${VSS[@]}" vios add rtsp://<url> --name <name>`, and record the `sensor_id` it
  reports. Passing `--name` is what avoids the classic mistake of VIOS silently naming the sensor
  `SENSOR`; the command reports the name it stored, so read that rather than assuming.
- Named existing sensor → `"${VSS[@]}" vios list --type stream --sensor <name>` before proceeding.
  `list` filters rather than resolves, so an unregistered name is `{"count": 0}` at exit 0, not an
  error. Branch on `count`, and treat a non-zero exit as a VIOS problem rather than a missing sensor.
  **`count: 0` ends the request.** Tell the user the sensor is not registered and stop — do not POST
  a rule to Alert Bridge with an invented `sensor_id` or `live_stream_url`. A rule created against a
  sensor that does not exist never fires, and it reads afterwards as monitoring that is in place.
- **Never hand-construct the RTSP URL.** For an NVStreamer-served stream, query NVStreamer for the served URL (`GET :31000/vst/api/v1/sensor/<name>/streams` → `url`) and register it **verbatim** — including its container-internal host/port (VST shares that docker network; a guessed `<host-ip>:<port>` or `localhost` URL is typically unreachable from the VST container and the stream never activates). After registering, confirm the sensor's row carries a non-empty `source` (`"${VSS[@]}" vios list --type stream`) before proceeding — an absent one means the source is unreachable and the registration must be redone.

On **CV**, adding the RTSP is the *entire* onboarding step (VIOS `camera_streaming` webhook registers the stream with RT-CV). On **VLM**, it is the prerequisite for creating a realtime alert rule (Workflow D).

---

## The Alert Bridge API (direct — no `/generate`)

Alert rule CRUD (Workflow D) and incident queries (Workflow C) call the **Alert Bridge REST API directly** — do **not** use the VSS Agent `POST /generate`, and do **not** call the `rtvi-vlm` microservice directly.

Resolve `$AB` / `$VST` once in *Deployment prerequisite* (Kubernetes forces
`${VSS_PUBLIC_URL}/alert-bridge` and `${VSS_PUBLIC_URL}`; Docker keeps
`:9080` / `:30888`). Do not reintroduce host-port overrides when
`VSS_PUBLIC_URL` is set.

**Availability check:** `curl -sf --connect-timeout 5 "$AB/health"` (note: `/health`, not `/api/v1/health`).

**Sensor resolution — two different identities, do not mix them:**

- **Rule create/replay (Workflow D)** resolves a sensor **name → `sensorId` (UUID) + RTSP `url`** via `vss vios list --type stream --sensor <name>` — RT-VLM keys its stream registration on the VIOS UUID. See `references/alert-subscriptions.md`.
- **Incident filtering (Workflow C)** takes the sensor **name**. Three similarly-spelled things meet here, so read carefully:
  - The **query parameter** is `sensor_id` (snake_case). `sensorId` is *not* recognised — the API ignores it and returns every incident in the store, so a store-wide total reads back as this sensor's.
  - Its **value** is the sensor *name*: `GET /api/v1/realtime/incidents?sensor_id=warehouse_sample`. It term-matches the `sensorId` field inside the incident documents, which RT-VLM fills from `sensor_name` on the Workflow D path.
  - Resolve the user's wording with `vss vios list` and carry the row's **`name`** forward, not its `sensor_id` — that field is the VIOS UUID. A UUID matches only the legacy case where the rule was created without a `sensor_name`; normally it silently returns zero.

Never fabricate a `sensor_id` or `live_stream_url`.

---

## Workflow A — CV Mode (`-m verification` / `MODE=2d_cv`)

CV alerts are **deployment-driven, not request-driven** — there is no agent
call to "create" one.

Bootstrap the CLI once (see [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) for the contract):

```bash
VSS_REPO_ROOT="${VSS_REPO_ROOT:-$HOME/video-search-and-summarization}"
VSS=(uv run --project "${VSS_REPO_ROOT}/libs/vss" vss)
"${VSS[@]}" configure --base-url "${VSS_PUBLIC_URL:-http://${HOST_IP:-localhost}:7777}"   # once per deployment
```

1. Check if the sensor is in VIOS with `"${VSS[@]}" vios list --type stream` (idempotent — don't blindly add).
2. If missing, onboard with `"${VSS[@]}" vios add rtsp://<url> --name <name>`. Once the sensor is online, VIOS posts `camera_streaming` to RT-CV (`notification_config_2d_cv.json` → `POST http://vss-rtvi-cv:9010/api/v1/stream/add`).
3. Confirm online — assert it, do not just print it:
   ```bash
   # Each block is its own shell; define what it uses.
   VSS=(uv run --project "${VSS_REPO_ROOT:-$HOME/video-search-and-summarization}/libs/vss" vss)
   set -o pipefail   # else a failed `vss` hides behind jq and reads as "absent"
   ROWS=$("${VSS[@]}" vios list --type stream --sensor <name>) || {
     echo "vss vios list failed for <name>" >&2; exit 1; }
   # The main stream's state is the sensor's state; a multi-stream camera has
   # several rows and picking .sensors[0] would be an arbitrary one.
   STATE=$(printf '%s' "${ROWS}" | jq -r 'first(.sensors[] | select(.is_main) | .state) // empty')
   [ "${STATE}" = "online" ] || { echo "sensor <name> is '${STATE:-absent}', not online" >&2; exit 1; }
   ```
4. Verified alerts land in Elasticsearch (`mdx-vlm-alerts-*`, Behavior Analytics → `alert-bridge` verification per `alert_type_config.json`). This store has **no REST query endpoint** — Workflow C's `/incidents` covers real-time incident-kind results only; inspect these CV behavior-alert verdicts via **Workflow B**'s interim ES probe.

A static-CV-pipeline alert on a VLM-only deployment is a mode mismatch — see the routing table above.

---

## Workflow B — Verification Results & Verdicts (CV mode)

How a CV alert becomes a verdict: RT-CV (Grounding DINO) detections → Behavior Analytics emits a candidate alert → Alert Bridge invokes the VLM verifier (prompts per `alert_type`) → the verified document lands in Elasticsearch **`mdx-vlm-alerts-*`** with `verdict` + `verificationResponseCode` in its `info` block.

1. **Explain / interpret** — verdict values are `confirmed` / `rejected` / `not-confirmed` / `verification-failed` / `""` (empty — the default `use_verdict: false` freestyle deploy or a pluggable parser; a valid state, **not** a failure); full table in `references/verification.md`.
2. **Inspect results — interim ES probe (Docker only).** This store has **no REST query endpoint yet** (a dedicated Alert Bridge endpoint is planned). On **Docker**, query Elasticsearch directly:
   ```bash
   if [ "${DEPLOYMENT_KIND:-docker}" != "kubernetes" ]; then
     curl -sf "http://${HOST_IP}:9200/mdx-vlm-alerts-*/_search?size=10" | jq '.hits.hits[]._source'
   fi
   ```
   On **Kubernetes**, Elasticsearch `:9200` is not on stock alerts Ingress — do
   not port-forward. Prefer Workflow C (`GET $AB/api/v1/realtime/incidents`)
   for real-time incident-kind results, or redeploy/ask for a Docker path when
   CV verdict inspection via `mdx-vlm-alerts-*` is required.
   An **empty hit list is a valid answer** — report "no verification results yet" and stop. Never substitute another source for a verdict question: not the rules list, not `/incidents`, and **not the `mdx-vlm-incidents-*` ES index** (that is Workflow C's incident store — its documents carry no verification verdicts; presenting them as "verdicts recorded" is a wrong answer even when `mdx-vlm-alerts-*` is empty). **Exception — on-demand follow-up:** if the ask follows an on-demand verification you just ran (Workflow F) and `mdx-vlm-alerts-*` is empty, do **not** dead-end here — that result is incident-kind. Continue in **Workflow F**: poll `GET $AB/api/v1/realtime/incidents` for the request's `correlationId` and report its `reasoning` / `vlm_response` (a default freestyle deploy carries no `verdict` field).
3. **Verifier-prompt config** — REST CRUD on `$AB/api/v1/verification/config[/{alert_type}]` (`GET` list / `GET` one / `POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE`), or the config-file + restart path — rules and payload shapes in `references/verification.md`.

Load `references/verification.md` for the full verdict table, probe recipes, and prompt-customization rules. CV mode only for execution; explain-only asks are answerable in any mode.

---

## Workflow D — Alert Rules (create / list / stop, VLM real-time mode only)

Create / list / delete persistent realtime alert rules on Alert Bridge (`POST` / `GET` / `DELETE $AB/api/v1/realtime`). Route here for **any** realtime-alert request on a sensor: rule keywords (`rule`, `subscription`, a rule ID), a sensor with a detection condition ("Set up a realtime alert on warehouse-dock-1 for PPE violations", "Watch entrance-1 for tailgating"), a **bare start with no condition** ("Start a real-time alert on warehouse_sample"), or "Stop rule 496aebd1-…".

- **With a condition** → send it verbatim as the `prompt`.
- **Without a condition** → use the skill's **default prompt** `"Describe any notable events or anomalies in this video stream."` and a generic `alert_type` (`general_monitoring`); don't ask the user for one.
- **Slack** operations → Workflow E instead.

**Stop/delete is a two-step, user-confirmed gate — stated here in full because it is the one rule agents skip.** A "stop" / "delete" / "remove" request produces a **question, never a `DELETE`**; only a subsequent explicit "yes" deletes. Resolve the rule with `GET $AB/api/v1/realtime` — for an exact `Stop rule <id>` request match that rule ID directly, otherwise filter by sensor + `alert_type` — then by match count: **0 matches** → say none found and issue **zero** `DELETE` calls; **>1** → list each as `` `<alert_type>` (rule ID: `<id>`) on **<sensor>** `` and ask which; **1** (or the exact-ID match) → reply **only** `Stop alert \`<alert_type>\` on **<sensor>**? (rule ID: \`<id>\`) — yes/no` and STOP.

> **This confirmation ALWAYS applies — including under autonomous / pre-authorized / non-interactive / CI execution.** A "run autonomously, do not pause for confirmation" instruction authorizes **deploy and setup ONLY**; it does **NOT** authorize you to skip this stop/delete confirmation or to issue the `DELETE` yourself. When no interactive user can answer (e.g. an eval harness), still emit the yes/no question naming the rule ID + sensor, then STOP — do **not** `DELETE`. `DELETE` is never a diagnostic/cleanup/retry probe.

`references/alert-subscriptions.md` is the full playbook. VLM real-time mode only; refuse with the canonical refusal text on CV.

---

## Workflow E — Slack Notifications (VLM real-time mode only)

Use when the user **explicitly mentions Slack or the webhook relay** (start/stop webhook server, check status/health, send a test message, set Slack channel/token). The word `notify` alone is **not** enough.

> **`alert-notify` (port 9090) ≠ `vss-alert-bridge` (`/api/v1/realtime`).**
> Do NOT touch `vss-alert-bridge` for Slack ops — Slack is never configured through Alert Bridge realtime rule APIs.

One relay, **two backends**: the `alert-notify` webhook server fans incidents out to **Slack** and/or the **OpenClaw Dashboard**, selected by `NOTIFY_BACKENDS` (default **`dashboard`** — a Slack setup MUST set `NOTIFY_BACKENDS=slack`, or `slack,dashboard` for both). The four skill-level ops all hit `:9090`: **status** (`GET /webhook/alert-notify/status`), **start** (creds gate below), **test** (POST a sample incident to `/webhook/alert-notify`), **stop**.

**Credentials gate before any start — both backends have one.** Slack needs `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`; the Dashboard needs `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` + `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN`. Being the *default* backend does not make the Dashboard zero-config — its init raises when either is unset. Both also need `VST_ENDPOINT`, and the server **exits at startup** on a failed Slack auth or missing `VST_ENDPOINT`.

**The gate is on `start` and `test` only.** `status` and `stop` never need credentials: to answer "is the webhook running?" probe `:9090` and say what you found — "not running, would you like me to start it?" — and ask for nothing. Requesting a token to report that a process is down is itself a failure of this check.

**When starting or testing, and the real credentials are absent: ask the operator and STOP.** Do not start the server. That much ALWAYS applies, including under autonomous / non-interactive / CI execution — "run autonomously" authorizes deploy and setup ONLY. None of the following counts as having credentials, and each has been tried:

- Placeholder or example values, wherever they came from — invented, `.env.example`, or **already sitting in `.env`**. A value being present is not a value being real.
- Pointing the relay at something other than Slack — a local mock, a stub server, `SLACK_API_BASE_URL` set to anything you started yourself.
- Editing the relay to get past the gate: skipping the Slack auth check, stubbing the client, patching the startup validation.
- Any other route to a green result that does not involve a message arriving in the operator's Slack.

A test that did not reach Slack was not a test. Report what blocked it — the server is not running, credentials are needed — and offer to start it once they exist. That report is the successful outcome here; a fabricated success is the only real failure. Again: this is about starting and testing. A status check just answers the question.

Routes here: "Set up Slack notifications", "Check if alert-notify is running", "Send a test alert to Slack". Does **not** route here: "Notify me when someone enters the zone" (→ Workflow D), "Alert and notify on my phone" (ambiguous — ask).

Load and follow `references/alert-notify.md`. Code lives in `scripts/alert-notify/`. VLM real-time mode only.

## Workflow F — On-Demand Verification (CV mode)

One-shot verification of a **specific media artifact** the user points at — never a continuous rule. Endpoint is **`POST $AB/api/v1/verification/ondemand`** (there is **no** `/verification/verify` route):

1. **Resolve the category first** — `GET $AB/api/v1/verification/config` and pick the existing `alert_type` matching the user's ask (e.g. a ladder/PPE config for a ladder-safety question). Never invent a category: an unknown one is a deterministic `400 {"error":"unknown_category"}`.
2. **Submit**:
   ```bash
   curl -sf -X POST "$AB/api/v1/verification/ondemand" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
     "category": "<alert_type from config>",
     "info": { "media_urls": ["<video/image URL>"], "media_type": "video" }
   }'
   ```
   Response is **HTTP 202** `{"status":"accepted","correlationId":"…","message":…,"timestamp":…}` — report the actual `correlationId` (server default `ondemand-<uuid>`; your own `id` field is used if you send one). 400 = `unknown_category` / `invalid_request` (`info.media_urls` list + `media_type` ∈ `video`|`image` are required).
3. **Result lands async — in the realtime incident store by default.** A minimal `{category, info}` submission is **incident-kind**: its result surfaces via Workflow C's **`GET $AB/api/v1/realtime/incidents`** — match the `correlationId` (= the incident `id`; the submission's `sensorId` defaults to `ondemand`). Only a submission that explicitly carries `notification_type: "alert"` lands in `mdx-vlm-alerts-*` (then use Workflow B's interim ES probe). Allow ≥2 min; the VLM must fetch the URL itself — an unreachable URL still lands a document via the **error path** (`verdict: "verification-failed"`, non-200 `verificationResponseCode`). **When describing the result fields**, report: `verificationResponseCode` (200 = VLM success, 4xx/5xx = error path) and the raw VLM output (`reasoning` / `vlm_response`) — and **always note that `verdict` may be absent or empty** on the default deploy (`use_verdict: false` freestyle mode); never present `verdict` as a guaranteed field.

Load `references/on-demand-verification.md` for the full contract, media constraints, and result-validation checklist. CV mode for execution; explain-only asks answerable anywhere. A 202 means **accepted**, not verified — never report a verdict at submit time.

---

## Workflow G — Always-On Operation (VLM real-time mode only)

Always-on alerting starts pre-configured rules automatically when VIOS posts a camera lifecycle webhook (`notification_config_2d_vlm.json` → `camera_streaming` starts one realtime rule per `always_on_rules` YAML entry; `camera_remove` tears them down) via `POST $AB/api/v1/realtime/always-on`. **Operate, don't author** — this workflow never creates or edits always-on rule config; it checks status, queries results, and troubleshoots.

1. **Status** — the feature is gated by `ALERT_AGENT_ALWAYS_ON` (substituted into `alert_agent.always_on` in the Alert Bridge config). `dev-profile.sh` sets it **true** for `-m real-time` (`MODE=2d_vlm`) and **false** for `-m verification` (`MODE=2d_cv`). There is **no** `/always-on/health` endpoint — do not invent one. Signals: the config gate itself, or the endpoint's reply to a benign `camera_remove` probe — `503 {"reason":"ALWAYS_ON_DISABLED"}` = off, anything else (e.g. `200 STREAM_REMOVE_SUCCESS`) = on. Zero-side-effect probe options in `references/always-on.md`.
2. **Query incidents** — always-on rules are ordinary realtime rules once started; their incidents surface through **Workflow C** (`GET $AB/api/v1/realtime/incidents`). The rules live in an **in-memory sidecar** (not the ES-backed rules index), so they may not appear in Workflow D's rules list — that is expected, not a bug.
3. **Troubleshoot "no always-on alerts"** — walk the ladder in `references/always-on.md`: feature gate → rules YAML resolves/validates at boot → VIOS webhooks actually reaching Alert Bridge → stream registered on `rtvi-vlm` → incidents query.

Load `references/always-on.md` for the event contract, reason-code table, the `ALWAYS_ON_RULES_CONFIG` rules-YAML contract, and the troubleshooting ladder. VLM real-time mode only; refuse on CV with the canonical text. Config authoring (editing `always_on_rules`) is **out of scope** in this pass — say so when asked.

---

## Workflow C — Query Incidents (real-time incident store)

Query past incidents **directly** from Alert Bridge — no `/generate`:

**The only parameter that scopes by sensor is `sensor_id`.** Any other spelling (e.g.
`?sensor=`) is silently ignored by the API (`realtime_routes.py:577` declares `sensor_id`;
FastAPI drops undeclared params), so `incident_service.py` builds no term clause and falls
through to `match_all` — the request looks sensor-scoped but returns the **whole store's**
total. Scope only with `--data-urlencode "sensor_id=..."`.

**Every `curl` in this workflow is an assertion, not a fetch.** `curl -sf`'s exit status is
swallowed by a `| jq` pipe, and `jq` exits `0` on empty input — so an unreachable Alert
Bridge yields empty/zero output that reads back as a real `count: 0`. Guard each call with
`jq -e` and `|| { echo "...unreachable..."; exit 2; }` so silent empty output fails loudly
instead of being reported as an answer.

**Keep step 1's resolution and the step 2/3 queries in ONE shell session** so `$NAME`/`$UUID`
persist and the `${VAR:?}` / `|| exit` guards fire — each fenced block in its own Bash call
loses the variables. But this is a **decision tree, not a top-to-bottom script**: run only
ONE query per the prose (unscoped **vs** name-scoped), run step 3 **only** when the scoped
count is 0, and take the unfiltered fallback **only** when VIOS is unreachable. The exit code
says which branch: `exit 1` / a failed `${VAR:?}` = stop and tell the user; the VIOS-down
`exit 2` = switch to the unfiltered `/incidents` fallback (do **not** report it as an error).
The explicit guards do the failure detection — do NOT wrap the blocks in `set -e`, which
(with `pipefail`) would abort the `grep`-no-match branch (an unknown sensor) before it can
tell the user what exists.

**If the ask names a sensor, resolve its exact stored name FIRST.** Never derive the value
from the user's phrasing: "the warehouse sample sensor" is English, not an identifier, and
guessing the separator (`warehouse-sample` vs `warehouse_sample`) filters on a value that
does not exist — which returns `count: 0`, not an error.

```bash
# 1. candidate names, from the source of truth. -F matches the wording literally: without it
#    a `.` or `[` in what the user typed is read as a pattern, which quietly matches a
#    different camera or errors out and reads back as "no such sensor".
# Keep the two failures apart: a dead VIOS and an unknown sensor both leave you with no
# name, but one means "use the fallback below" and the other means "tell the user".
VSS=(uv run --project "${VSS_REPO_ROOT:-$HOME/video-search-and-summarization}/libs/vss" vss)
LIST=$("${VSS[@]}" vios list --type stream) || { echo "VIOS unreachable — exit 2 means: continue with the unfiltered /incidents fallback below (do NOT report an error)"; exit 2; }
# sort -u: one sensor registered twice is one name, not an ambiguous choice between two.
# No separate parse guard: the CLI exits non-zero on a backend failure rather than
# handing back a 200 with a malformed body, so there is no "unparseable data" case
# left to mistake for an empty sensor list.
NAMES=$(printf '%s' "$LIST" | jq -r '.sensors[] | .name')
MATCHES=$(printf '%s' "$NAMES" | grep -Fi -- "<user's wording, e.g. warehouse>" | sort -u)
# Stop unless exactly one name matched — anything else is a question for the user, not a guess
[ "$(printf '%s\n' "$MATCHES" | grep -c .)" = 1 ] || { printf '%s\n' "$MATCHES"; exit 1; }
NAME="$MATCHES"
```

No match means the sensor is not registered: say so and list what exists. Several matches
mean the wording is ambiguous (`warehouse_sample` and `warehouse_sample_2` both contain
"warehouse") — show them and ask which one. Do not take the first: it answers about a
different camera, and its count looks exactly as valid as the right one. Feeding all of them
to the query is worse, because the joined value matches nothing and reads back as `count: 0`.

Fall back to an unfiltered `/incidents` response only when VIOS is unavailable — and fetch it
with the cap, not the browse default: `ALL=$(curl -sf "$AB/api/v1/realtime/incidents?limit=1000" | jq -e .) || { echo "Alert Bridge unreachable — cannot answer"; exit 2; }`.
(The `?limit=20` call in (a) below is for the no-sensor recent-list case; here you need the
whole store to count client-side, so `count == total` can actually hold.) It carries
the same strings, so the values already in it are the candidate list —
`jq -r '.incidents[].sensorId' | sort -u` — and the rule above applies to them unchanged:
exactly one match with the user's wording is the sensor, several is a question for the user,
none means you cannot answer. Never reconstruct the identity by guessing case or separators;
the point of this fallback is that the stored strings are in front of you.

That response is **not** an answer on its own: its `count`/`total` covers every sensor in the
store, so count only the documents carrying the matched value, and say the name could not be
confirmed against VIOS. Counting what came back is only sound while `count == total`.
When they differ the page was truncated: re-request with `--data-urlencode "limit=1000"` (the
endpoint's cap; the default is 100) and page with `offset` if it still truncates. Do not
narrow the asked-for window to make the numbers agree — that answers about a different period
(step 3 states the same "don't narrow the window" rule). If it still truncates at the cap, say the list was cut short and
report the bound, not the number. This list
is weaker than VIOS in one way worth stating to the user: it only contains sensors that have
**produced** incidents. When nothing matches, you cannot tell "this sensor has no incidents"
from "that is not its stored name" — report that ambiguity instead of reporting `0`.

```bash
# Each block is its own shell; define what it uses.
VSS=(uv run --project "${VSS_REPO_ROOT:-$HOME/video-search-and-summarization}/libs/vss" vss)
# 2. query — run ONE of these two, never both: the unscoped call answers a different
#    question, and its count is the one that gets misreported as a single sensor's.

# (a) the ask named NO sensor — recent incidents across every sensor
curl -sf "$AB/api/v1/realtime/incidents?limit=20" | jq -e . \
  || { echo "Alert Bridge unreachable — no incidents to report; do NOT read this as empty"; exit 2; }

# (b) the ask named a sensor — scope to it, passing the NAME, not a VIOS UUID.
# Let curl encode it: a name with a space or reserved character breaks a hand-built URL,
# and a mangled value filters on something else (silent zero) instead of erroring.
: "${NAME:?resolve the name first — an empty sensor_id is dropped, not rejected, and the
   response then covers every sensor in the store}"
# Omit start_time/end_time for an all-time count — the endpoint applies NO range filter
# without them. Add them ONLY when the user named a period, and then as real ISO-8601 values,
# never the literal `<ISO>` (which 422s). A window you invent answers about a different period.
curl -sfG "$AB/api/v1/realtime/incidents" \
  --data-urlencode "sensor_id=$NAME" | jq -e . \
  || { echo "Alert Bridge unreachable — no answer; do NOT read this as count 0"; exit 2; }
# windowed ask → add:  --data-urlencode "start_time=$START" --data-urlencode "end_time=$END"

# 3. a scoped `count: 0` is not an answer yet: a rule created without `sensor_name` stores the
#    stream id instead, so the rows exist under the UUID. There are only these two identities
#    to try — ask about the second one directly. `total` is the full match count, so this is
#    exact at any `limit`, and needs no paging through the store.
UUID=$("${VSS[@]}" vios list --type stream --sensor "$NAME" | jq -r 'first(.sensors[] | select(.is_main) | .sensor_id) // empty' | sort -u)
# same trap as $NAME, and it springs while you are being careful: if VIOS died or dropped the
# sensor since step 1, an empty $UUID is dropped from the query and the store-wide total comes
# back as this sensor's — turning "none" into someone else's incidents.
: "${UUID:?VIOS no longer resolves this sensor — say the alternate identity could not be checked}"
# Same dedup as step 1 (${UUID:?} only tests emptiness): a two-line $UUID goes on the wire as
# sensor_id=<uuid>%0A<uuid> and matches nothing — collapse it; if two distinct ids remain, ask.
[ "$(printf '%s\n' "$UUID" | grep -c .)" = 1 ] || { printf '%s\n' "$UUID"; exit 1; }
# Carry the SAME window choice as (b): omit start_time/end_time for an all-time count, or
# add the SAME window the user asked for. Mismatching (b) answers a different question — the
# endpoint applies no range filter without them, so an all-time total comes back for a "today" ask.
TOTAL=$(curl -sfG "$AB/api/v1/realtime/incidents" \
  --data-urlencode "sensor_id=$UUID" | jq -e '.total') \
  || { echo "Alert Bridge unreachable — the alternate-identity check did not run; do NOT report a zero"; exit 2; }
# windowed ask → add the same:  --data-urlencode "start_time=$START" --data-urlencode "end_time=$END"
# jq -e exits non-zero on null/absent output, so an empty body (Alert Bridge down) fails the
# assignment rather than yielding "" that reads back as a checked zero.
# $TOTAL > 0 → that is the answer; say it matched the sensor's UUID, not its name. Exactly 10000 is
#   the one number to distrust: this raw view never asks Elasticsearch for an exact hit count,
#   and paging cannot go past it either, so 10000 is a floor. Report it as "at least 10000" —
#   that is the true answer, not a fallback. Only narrow the window if the user asks for a
#   finer figure, and then say which window the new number belongs to.
# 0 as well → both identities are empty, so "none found" is now a checked answer.

Response is an `IncidentListResponse`: `{ "status", "incidents": [...], "count", "total", "timestamp" }`. `total` here is Elasticsearch's thresholded hit count: exact below 10000, saturating at it, and the response does not carry the flag that tells those two apart — so exactly 10000 is a lower bound, not a count. Summarize each incident's timestamp, sensor (report `sensorId` as returned — usually the name, no reverse lookup needed), and category. **Run the query — never answer from memory.** An **empty `incidents` list is a valid answer once it has been checked** — when the ask named a sensor, a scoped zero means *not under this identity*, so run step 3 before reporting it. Then report "none found / count 0" and STOP; do not fall back to listing rules. When the ask named a sensor, the count you report is the **scoped** one: quote **`total`** from the response you filtered by the identity you confirmed — the name, or the UUID step 3 matched — and say which sensor, and which identity, it belongs to. `total` is how many matched; `count` is how many came back in the page you asked for, and it stops at `limit` (100 by default), so quoting it turns 500 incidents into 100 without any sign that it did. A `0` read off the unfiltered query answers a different question — and it is also what a mistyped name returns, so neither you nor the reader can tell the two apart afterwards.

**Casual phrasings route here too** — "Any alerts so far today?", "What's been triggered?", "Anything detected lately?" are all incident queries. A bare "alerts" question is *always* an incident lookup (C), never a rule listing (D). Incidents produced by **always-on** rules (Workflow G) appear here like any other realtime incident, and so do **on-demand verification results** (incident-kind, `sensorId: "ondemand"` — see Workflow F).

> **Do NOT list subscription rules for an incident query.** The **bare** `GET /api/v1/realtime` (no `/incidents`) lists *rules* (Workflow D) and is wrong for "what happened".

**Scope — real-time incident-kind results only.** CV / Behavior-Analytics verified alerts (PPE, ladder, proximity, restricted-area) are stored in a separate `mdx-vlm-alerts-*` index with **no REST query endpoint**, so this call does **not** surface them — in a CV deployment it typically returns empty for those. For time-range / occupancy / PPE metrics use the **`vss-query-analytics` skill** (VA-MCP :9901).

### Verdict interpretation (CV mode)

CV-verified alerts carry `verdict` + `verificationResponseCode` + `reasoning` in their `info` block; VLM real-time incidents have no separate verdict (the trigger is itself a Yes/No answer). Verdict table, result inspection, and verifier-prompt rules → **Workflow B** / `references/verification.md`.

## Gotchas

- **`alert-notify` (port 9090) ≠ `vss-alert-bridge`.** Slack ops → Workflow E (`alert-notify`); never route Slack to `vss-alert-bridge`'s `/api/v1/realtime`.
- **Workflow scope by mode:** A, B, and F are CV-only (B/F explain-only asks answerable anywhere); **C queries the real-time incident store** (`/api/v1/realtime/incidents`; CV behavior-alert verdicts live in `mdx-vlm-alerts-*` — **no REST query endpoint yet**, use Workflow B's interim ES probe); D, E, and G are VLM real-time only (refuse on CV with the canonical text).
- **On-demand verification is `POST /api/v1/verification/ondemand`** — not `/verification/verify`, not a realtime rule, not `/generate`. 202 = accepted (async), never a verdict.
- **Always-on has no health endpoint** — status is the `alert_agent.always_on` config gate or the reply to a benign `camera_remove` probe on `POST /api/v1/realtime/always-on`: `503 ALWAYS_ON_DISABLED` means off, anything else (e.g. `200 STREAM_REMOVE_SUCCESS`) means on. Its rules are in-memory (not in the ES rules index), so absence from Workflow D's rules list is expected.
- **The gate follows the deploy mode — don't assume it is off.** `dev-profile.sh`
  sets `ALERT_AGENT_ALWAYS_ON=true` for `-m real-time` (`MODE=2d_vlm`) and
  `false` for `-m verification` (`MODE=2d_cv`), so always-on is normally
  **already active** on the deploy where Workflow G applies. Report the state
  you probed, never a remembered default, and don't blame a disabled gate for
  missing always-on alerts on a real-time deploy — walk the rest of the chain
  (rules YAML, VIOS `camera_streaming` webhooks, `rtvi-vlm` stream
  registration) per `references/always-on.md`.
- **To describe how always-on is turned on or off**, say what applies to the
  deployment in front of you. On Docker it is a **deploy-mode choice** —
  redeploy with `the `/vss-build-vision-ai` stock Alerts workflow in real-time mode` (or
  `-m verification` to turn it off); never hand-edit config and restart. On
  **Kubernetes the chart exposes no switch for it**: `services/alert/configs/config.yml`
  pins `always_on: false` as a literal, carrying an explicit "Helm keeps this
  disabled … do not align them" note, and nothing in `values.yaml` or the pod
  env maps to `alert_agent.always_on` — the chart wires only
  `ALWAYS_ON_RULES_CONFIG` and already ships a non-empty rules YAML, so the
  rules are never the missing piece and a config change already restarts the
  pod via the `checksum/config` annotation. On Kubernetes, report that
  always-on is off and not enablable through the chart's supported surface;
  do **not** hand the operator a set-the-gate-and-restart recipe the chart
  will not honor. Either way, make no config changes in this operate-only
  workflow.
- **Don't use `vss-rtvi-vlm` as a mode signal** — it runs in both modes. Use `vss-behavior-analytics` (CV-only) or the `MODE` env var.
- **A mode switch tears down the current deployment** — running VLM streams and un-persisted CV alert state are lost.
- **Alert ops call Alert Bridge (`:9080`) directly** — the skill does not use the VSS Agent `/generate`, and never calls `rtvi-vlm` directly. The VLM trigger is a `"yes"`/`"true"` token match (case-insensitive); prompts must force a Yes/No answer.
- **Sensor must already be in VIOS** for either mode (use `vss-manage-video-io-storage` for RTSP-only inputs).
- **Report only values an API actually returned** — never invent rule IDs, sensor IDs, incident counts, or timestamps, and never claim an action succeeded without its API response (this includes replies that decline or hand off a request).
- **End your turn by answering the CURRENT request** — the final reply must address what the user just asked (even when handing off out-of-scope work); never close with the status or summary of a different or earlier task.
- **Never onboard a sensor the user didn't explicitly ask to onboard.** A named-but-missing sensor is a *not-found report* (say so, list what exists, ask) — creating/registering one as a workaround and proceeding is a critical failure.
