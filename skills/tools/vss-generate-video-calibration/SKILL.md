## When to Use This Skill

Run AutoMagicCalib end-to-end on local files, RTSP streams, or the bundled sample dataset and (when needed) deploy the AMC microservice.

Do not use for non-AMC camera calibration or runtime analytics.

## Workflow

Follow the routing tables and step-by-step workflows below. Each section that ends in *workflow*, *quick start*, or *flow* is intended to be executed top-to-bottom. Detailed reference material lives in `references/`; load only the reference needed for the selected input mode.

## Examples

Worked end-to-end examples are kept under `evals/` (each `*.json` manifest contains a runnable scenario) and inline in the per-workflow `curl` blocks below. Run a Tier-3 evaluation with `nv-base validate <this-skill-dir> --agent-eval` to replay them.

## Limitations

- Requires the matching VSS profile / microservice to be deployed and reachable from the caller.
- NGC-hosted models and NIMs may be subject to rate-limits, GPU memory requirements, and license restrictions.
- Concurrency, GPU memory, and storage limits depend on the host hardware and the profile's compose file.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error**: REST call returns connection refused. **Cause**: target microservice not running. **Solution**: probe `/docs` or `/health`; redeploy via `vss-build-vision-ai` or the matching `vss-deploy-*` skill.
- **Error**: HTTP 401/403 from NGC pulls. **Cause**: missing/expired `NGC_CLI_API_KEY`. **Solution**: `docker login nvcr.io` and re-export the key before retrying.
- **Error**: container OOM or model fails to load. **Cause**: insufficient GPU memory for the selected profile. **Solution**: switch to a smaller variant or free GPUs via `docker compose down`.

# VSS Generate Video Calibration

Run AutoMagicCalib over one of three input sources and drive the calibration through the microservice REST API. The input-resolution work differs per source; everything from `verify_project` onward is identical and lives in this file. Pick the right input-mode reference and pair it with the [Shared Calibration Tail](#shared-calibration-tail) below.

Shared helper references are loaded only when needed:
- Read [`references/common-steps.md`](references/common-steps.md) when a mode reference needs the shared `create_project`, video-upload, or handoff snippets.
- Read [`references/calibration-tail.md`](references/calibration-tail.md) when you need the reusable Python implementation of the stage-linear-media → verify → VGGT/post-process → AMC/post-process → compare-results tail.

## Input Routing

Match the user's request to a mode, then load that mode's reference for input collection, mode-specific API calls, and the full Python script.

| User says / has | Mode | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| "launch AMC" / "deploy auto-calibration" / "set up auto-magic-calib" / "start AMC microservice" | `deploy` | [`references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md`](references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md) |
| "calibrate my videos" / "calibrate from video files" / local MP4 files | `videos` | [`references/videos.md`](references/videos.md) |
| "calibrate RTSP streams" / "calibrate from live cameras" / live RTSP URLs | `rtsp` | [`references/rtsp.md`](references/rtsp.md) |
| "test sample dataset" / "verify AMC install" / "launch and test" | `sample-dataset` | [`references/sample-dataset.md`](references/sample-dataset.md) |

**Disambiguation rule:** if the user is asking to launch / deploy / set up AMC (no calibration verb) → `deploy`. If they provide RTSP URLs → `rtsp`. If they mention local files / a videos directory → `videos`. If they ask to verify install or test the bundled sample → `sample-dataset`. Combined intents (e.g. "launch AMC and calibrate my videos") → walk `deploy` first, then the calibration mode. When ambiguous, ask via `AskUserQuestion`.

## Prerequisites (shared across calibration modes)

- Platform preflight from [`references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md` Step 0](references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md#step-0--platform-preflight) passes before any AMC deploy or calibration API work. The calibration host needs Ubuntu 24.04 on `x86_64`, NVIDIA Driver 590 or newer, NVIDIA GPU access, and NVENC hardware encoder support. If the preflight fails, stop immediately, tell the user which requirement was not met, and ask them to provide an existing `calibration.json`, run calibration on a supported `x86_64` dGPU host, or transfer generated calibration artifacts. Do not continue AMC setup, VIOS probing, capture, upload, or calibration automatically. DGX Spark is `aarch64`, so use existing/generated artifacts for this flow.
- AMC microservice + UI running. If not, walk [`references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md`](references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md) first.
- Microservice reachable at `http://<HOST_IP>:${VSS_AUTO_CALIBRATION_HOST_PORT:-8010}/v1/ready` → `{"code":0,...}`.
- Projects directory writable by the container user. If you didn't just deploy (so Step 5 of the deploy reference hasn't run), confirm the write test in [`references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md` § Step 5](references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md#step-5--confirm-the-projects-directory-is-writable) — otherwise the first `create_project` returns `[Errno 13] Permission denied`.
- Python 3 with `requests` installed (each input-mode reference includes a self-healing venv fallback for direct runs).

Mode-specific prerequisites (VIOS for `rtsp`, sample zip for `sample-dataset`) live in the respective references. The platform preflight applies even when an AMC service is already running.

## Shared Calibration Tail

The shared sequence is stage-linear-media → verify → VGGT (when ready) → post-process → AMC → post-process → results. After the mode-specific reference has uploaded videos / automatically ingested RTSP clips / uploaded the bundled sample, run this tail. Use [`references/calibration-tail.md`](references/calibration-tail.md) for the shared Python snippet.

AMC UI sequence: Step 1 Project Setup, Step 2 Video Configuration, Step 3 Parameters, Step 4 Rectification, Step 5 Manual Alignment, Step 6 Execute, Step 7 Results.

### Step A — Stage Linear Media

AMC v3.3.0 cannot calibrate raw media. After the mode-specific workflow has uploaded videos or completed RTSP ingest, explicitly choose one path before verification:

- **Already-linear/pinhole media** — call `POST /v1/linear_media/<project_id>` and require `rectification_state == "COMPLETED"`.
- **Distorted media** — open AMC UI Step 4: Rectification; select Auto, Manual, or Videos Are Rectified; review the estimate; then click Generate Rectified Videos. Auto supports `simple_divisional` (default), `simple_radial`, and `radial`; Manual supports per-camera `model`, `k1`, and `k2` for `radial`. `READY_FOR_REVIEW` is not complete: require `rectification_state == "COMPLETED"` before continuing. Re-rectification invalidates verification, calibration, and post-processing outputs.

For REST-only rectification, use the running AMC service contract exposed by `<MS_URL>/docs` (OpenAPI: `<MS_URL>/openapi.yaml`):

1. **Auto** — `POST /v1/rectification/<project_id>` starts frame-0 estimation. Poll `GET /v1/rectification/<project_id>` until `READY_FOR_REVIEW`; then `GET /v1/rectification/<project_id>/cameras`, review every `auto_estimate`, and commit all camera parameters with `POST /v1/rectification/<project_id>/manual` using `{"cameras":{"cam_00":{"model":"...","k1":0.0,"k2":0.0},...}}`. This explicit commit generates full rectified videos.
2. **Manual** — `POST /v1/rectification/<project_id>/manual/start`; optionally preview each adjustment through `POST /v1/rectification/<project_id>/preview/<camera_id>`; then commit a complete per-camera `cameras` map to `POST /v1/rectification/<project_id>/manual`.
3. Poll `GET /v1/rectification/<project_id>` until `COMPLETED`. Stop on `ERROR`; do not verify or calibrate from `READY_FOR_REVIEW`.

Rectification produces `rectified.mp4` and `rectified.jpg`. External alignment files normally use `coord_space=original`; use `rectified` only for points created on AMC rectified media. Never call `/v1/calibrate/<project_id>` before the linear-media or rectification state is complete.

### Step B — Verify Project

```
POST /v1/verify_project/<project_id>
```

Response: `{"project_state": "READY"}` — must be `READY` before calibrating. If not READY, re-check that videos + alignment + layout are present (either via API or via UI manual alignment).

### Step C — Independent VGGT Calibration

After verification and before AMC, inspect `vggt_state`. Start VGGT by default from `READY`, resume and wait from `RUNNING`, and always post-process a `COMPLETED` multi-camera result, including one completed before the current invocation. `MODEL_MISSING` or `ERROR` is reported as an AMC-only fallback. Check `amc_state`, `vggt_state`, and `postprocess_state` independently.

```
POST /v1/vggt/calibrate/<project_id>
GET  /v1/get_project_info/<project_id>                    # poll vggt_state
POST /v1/postprocess/<project_id>                          # multi-camera only, after VGGT
GET  /v1/get_project_info/<project_id>                    # require postprocess_state == COMPLETED
GET  /v1/vggt_results/<project_id>/evaluation_statistics  # VGGT metrics when GT exists
```

### Step D — Start AMC Calibration

**Confirm the plan before calibrating.** Whether the settings file and detector were auto-detected or asked, present a short summary and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` before the `POST /calibrate`. The resolved values are the defaults, so confirming is one click — but the user can switch the detector or skip an auto-detected settings file. Summarize:

- **Detector** — `resnet` or `transformer` (the value to be sent).
- **Calibration settings** — the file being applied (path), or default parameters (with the option to tune them in the UI first — see below).
- **Optional overrides** — ground-truth zip and focal lengths, if any.

The sample-dataset install-check run uses a fixed `resnet` and can proceed without this confirmation.

```
POST /v1/calibrate/<project_id>
Content-Type: application/json

{"detector_type": "resnet"}   # or "transformer"
```

`detector_type` is a separate `/calibrate` parameter — **not** consumed by `/v1/config/<id>`. If the user provided a calibration settings file, parse it for `"detector"` / `"detector_type"` and use that value. If the file doesn't specify one, the default (`resnet`) is the value shown in the confirmation above — the user can switch it there before calibrating. If there's no settings file at all, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

- `resnet` — default, fast.
- `transformer` — slower, better under heavy occlusion.

UI Step 3 (Parameters) does NOT cover detector choice; never assume the user picked one in the UI.

**Also when there's no settings file, ask whether to tune the calibration parameters first** (`AskUserQuestion`):

- **Proceed with the default parameters** — well-suited to typical warehouse scenes; recommended unless the user has specific tuning in mind.
- **Adjust parameters in the UI first** — open the project, go to Step 3: Parameters, change values, and click Save; then continue.

In Step 3, set `layout_px_per_m` directly or measure a known two-point distance. Re-run post-processing after a scale or alignment change.

Wait for the user's choice — and, if they choose to tune, for them to confirm they've Saved — before calling `/calibrate`.

### Step E — Poll for AMC Completion

```
GET /v1/get_project_info/<project_id>
```

Poll every 10 s. Use `project_info.amc_state` for AMC completion; aggregate `project_state` is not a pipeline-success signal.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `RUNNING` | AMC calibration in progress |
| `COMPLETED` | Finished |
| `ERROR` | Failed — pull log via `GET /v1/amc/calibrate/<id>/log` |

When calibration starts, surface the project ID, the UI URL (`http://<HOST_IP>:${VSS_AUTO_CALIBRATION_UI_HOST_PORT:-5000}`), and the log endpoint so the user can watch progress while the run proceeds. During `RUNNING`, emit a progress line at least once a minute with elapsed time so a long run doesn't look stalled. On `ERROR`, fetch and show the last lines of `GET /v1/amc/calibrate/<id>/log` before stopping. Live logs can also be streamed via `GET /v1/calibrate/<project_id>/log/<type>/stream`.

Typical time: **10–60 min** (your-own videos), **10–30 min** (bundled sample). A six-camera transformer run can exceed one hour; keep polling and inspect logs/UI instead of treating 60 minutes as failure.

### Step F — AMC Post-process and Results

For multi-camera projects, run layout post-processing after AMC calibration. VGGT, when available, runs first and is post-processed before AMC.

```
POST /v1/postprocess/<project_id>
GET  /v1/get_project_info/<project_id>  # poll postprocess_state until COMPLETED
```

Do not report a multi-camera project as successful until `postprocess_state == "COMPLETED"`; raw AMC results may exist even when post-processing fails.

```
GET /v1/get_project_info/<project_id>                    # project state
GET /v1/result/<project_id>/evaluation_statistics        # only if GT uploaded
GET /v1/result/<project_id>/overlay_image                # visual overlay (PNG)
GET /v1/amc/calibrate/<project_id>/log                   # calibration log
```

Evaluation response includes `Average L2 distance(m)` and `Average reprojection error 0(px)`. Evaluation metrics are produced **only when a ground-truth `GT.zip` was uploaded** — a missing `evaluation_statistics` result is normal otherwise and is not the end of result reporting. When VGGT also completed, compare both methods' metrics and Results-page overlays, then select the more accurate calibration for export.

After `COMPLETED`, always give the user a way to review the result for that exact project, regardless of whether metrics exist:

- **UI** — `http://<HOST_IP>:${VSS_AUTO_CALIBRATION_UI_HOST_PORT:-5000}`; open the project, then the Results page to view the overlay.
- **Overlay image on disk** — `${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects/project_<id>/output/multi_view_results/BA_output/results_ba_scaled_world/overlay_img_*.png` (single-camera projects use `output/single_view_results/cam_00/verification_map_overlay.png`).
- **Project files** — `${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects/project_<id>/`.

## Settings File + Detector Pattern

Optional across all three modes. Before using a JSON settings file, retrieve `GET /v1/config/defaults` and inspect `<MS_URL>/openapi.yaml` (or `<MS_URL>/docs`) from the running AMC version. Parse the file, reject known-invalid legacy `skip` rather than silently translating it to `skip_frame`, then submit the JSON unchanged in meaning. Do not treat `/config/defaults` as a complete allow-list: the running API is the authoritative schema validator.

```
POST /v1/config/<project_id>
Content-Type: application/json

<parsed JSON object; submit as application/json>
```

The file replaces what the user would otherwise tune in UI Step 3 (parameters, bundle-adjustment, and evaluation knobs). Rectification is UI Step 4 and follows Step A. After a successful POST, **also** parse the file for `"detector"` / `"detector_type"` — if it's `"resnet"` or `"transformer"`, use that value for the `/calibrate` call in Step D (detector is a separate API parameter, not consumed by `/config`).

Non-2xx is surfaced — do not silently fall back. Skip this call entirely if the user chose the UI-fallback path.

## UI Fallback Pattern

When alignment / layout files aren't on disk, direct the user to the appropriate AMC UI step:

- **Settings missing** → "Open UI project `<project_id>`, go to **Step 3: Parameters**, tune via the settings dialog (or accept defaults), click Save." **Also**: before the `/calibrate` call, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` whether to use the `resnet` or `transformer` detector — Step 3 doesn't cover detector choice.
- **Layout missing** → "Open UI project `<project_id>`, go to **Step 2: Video Configuration**, upload `layout.png` only (do NOT re-upload videos — they're already attached via API/RTSP), click Save."
- **Alignment missing** → "Open UI project `<project_id>`, go to **Step 5: Manual Alignment**, either upload `alignment_data.json` or mark correspondence points on the layout, click Save."

Wait for user confirmation. For alignment/layout, verify on disk before continuing:

```bash
# Project state lives under $VSS_APPS_DIR/services/auto-calibration/projects
# (the path bind-mounted into the MS container in
#  deploy/docker/services/auto-calibration/ms/compose.yml).
HOST_PROJECTS="${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects"

ls "$HOST_PROJECTS/project_<project_id>/manual_adjustment/"
# Expected: alignment_data.json, layout.png
```

## Success Criteria

- `amc_state == "COMPLETED"` after polling; if VGGT ran, `vggt_state == "COMPLETED"` too.
- If manual alignment was used: `${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects/project_<id>/manual_adjustment/` contains `alignment_data.json` + `layout.png`.
- If GT was uploaded: fetch both available methods' evaluation statistics and compare their metrics plus overlays before selecting the result to export. Typical thresholds are `Average L2 distance(m)` < 1.5 and `Average reprojection error 0(px)` < 5 for your data or < 10 for the bundled sample.
- No `ERROR` state.

## Cross-cutting Troubleshooting

Mode-specific issues live in each reference's own troubleshooting table.

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `verify_project` state not `READY` | Confirm videos uploaded/ingested and alignment + layout are present (either via API or via UI manual alignment). Mode-specific upload steps in the reference. |
| Manual alignment files missing after UI step | User didn't click Save; also verify `${VSS_APPS_DIR}/services/auto-calibration/projects/project_<id>/manual_adjustment/` exists. |
| Calibration stuck `RUNNING` > 90 min | `GET /v1/amc/calibrate/<id>/log` — usually insufficient tracklets (scene too static). See "Custom Dataset" guidelines in root `README.md`. |
| Immediate `ERROR` state | Check video readability, synchronization, overlapping fields of view, and camera order; upload order defines indices. |
| Low L2 but high reprojection | Provide explicit `focal_length` override during input upload (see videos / rtsp references). |
| VGGT `INIT`, never `READY` | VGGT model not loaded — see [`references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md`](references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md) Step 2. |
| Upload timeout | Large videos — bump `timeout=300` to e.g. `600` in the per-mode Python script. |
| Port scan finds no backend | Backend not running — walk [`references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md`](references/deploy-auto-calibration-service.md) first. |

## For Downstream Skills — MV3DT Export

Downstream consumers (e.g. a Multi-View 3D Tracking skill owned by another team) fetch the MV3DT-format calibration output directly from the microservice. This skill returns the `project_id`; the downstream skill calls:

```
GET /v1/result/{project_id}/mv3dt_result?result_type=amc
# Response: application/zip — mv3dt_output.zip containing transforms.yml
```

For independent VGGT output (only available if VGGT ran to `COMPLETED`, see Step C):

```
GET /v1/result/{project_id}/mv3dt_result?result_type=vggt
# Response: application/zip — vggt_mv3dt_output.zip
```

Downstream skill flow:
1. Call this skill with the user's inputs; capture the printed `project_id`.
2. Wait for the skill to return (it polls until `COMPLETED` internally).
3. `GET /v1/result/{project_id}/mv3dt_result?result_type=amc` — save the ZIP locally.
4. If independent VGGT calibration also ran, optionally fetch `?result_type=vggt` for the VGGT MV3DT result.
