# @nv-metropolis-bp-vss-ui/chat

VSS chat interface for the chat tab and the docked sidebar.

Its primary transport is the versioned VSS agent API exposed by the embedded
adapter. The original OpenAI-shaped chat-SSE transport remains available for
deployments that have not enabled that adapter.

## Source provenance

Components and helpers marked `MIT AND Apache-2.0` retain code derived from the
MIT-licensed NeMo Agent Toolkit UI and include contributions made in this
repository under Apache-2.0. Files marked only `Apache-2.0` are original work
authored for this repository.

## Usage

```tsx
import { ChatPanel } from '@nv-metropolis-bp-vss-ui/chat';
import '@nv-metropolis-bp-vss-ui/chat/lib/chat.css';

<ChatPanel
  endpoint={{
    url: '/api/agent',
    transport: 'agent-api',
    surface: 'vss-ui-sidebar',
    mediaProxyUrl: '/api/proxy',
    uploadUrlBase: vstApiBase,
  }}
  title="Vision Agent"
  theme="dark"
  storageKeyPrefix="appSidebar"
  features={{ uploadFile: true, messageCopy: false }}
  onAnswer={(answer, conversationId) => forwardToSearchTab(answer, conversationId)}
  onSubmit={() => clearStaleResults()}
  onSubmitMessageReady={(submit) => (submitRef.current = submit)}
  onAddQueryContextReady={(add) => (addContextRef.current = add)}
  onControlsReady={(handlers) => setSidebarControls(handlers)}
/>
```

### Per-surface configuration

The chat tab and the docked sidebar are configured independently: the sidebar
overrides any main variable by re-declaring it under `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIDEBAR_CHAT_`,
and falls back to the main value otherwise. This deployment relies on it — the
sidebar runs a different agent from the chat tab and exposes its own parameter
fields (search source type, critic toggle). `Home.tsx` resolves both surfaces
through `surfaceEnv`.

### Deliberately not ported

- **WebSocket transport** and its `webSocketSchema` / connection toggle. Both
  supported transports are HTTP + SSE, and the deployment ships
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_SOCKET_DEFAULT_ON=false`.
- **Adapter human-in-the-loop interaction responses.** Structured interaction
  UI is opt-in. The legacy `vss-agent` chat-SSE transport exposes its response
  modal only while `ENABLE_HITL=true`.
  Current adapter connectors advertise `interaction_responses: false`, so an
  interaction event is shown as unsupported instead of presenting a form that
  cannot submit a response. External OpenClaw deployments set the flag false
  and ask follow-up questions as ordinary completed chat turns.
- **Folders and prompt templates.** Never surfaced in VSS. Import still accepts
  and preserves both keys so an export round-trips.
- **`GraphPlot` charts** (`react-force-graph-2d`). Not installed in this
  workspace and not emitted by any VSS workflow; the type renders as
  "unsupported" rather than pulling in a graph engine for a case that never
  fires.

### Deliberate differences

- **Intermediate steps are a React tree, not serialised HTML.** The tree stays
  structured here; the repairs are kept only for markup the *model* emits
  mid-stream (`markdown/streaming.ts`).
- **Pie slice colours are a fixed palette.** Random colours inside render would
  recolour the chart on every streamed token.
- **Syntax highlighting loads on demand.** Prism and its grammars are several
  hundred kilobytes and only needed once a fenced block has stopped changing.

## Wire protocol

With `transport: 'agent-api'`, a turn creates a run through `POST /runs` and then
reads the returned `events_url` as SSE. Every `data:` payload is a versioned
agent API event.

| Agent API event | UI behavior |
|---|---|
| `run.started`, `run.completed` | run status step and terminal state |
| `message.delta` | assistant text |
| `reasoning.delta` | reasoning step |
| `tool.*` | keyed tool-step updates |
| `artifact.created` | validated artifact delivered to `onAnswer`, not rendered as prose |
| `interaction.required` | unsupported-interaction error (no response UI) |
| `run.failed`, `run.cancelled` | terminal error |

Absolute `*_url` values in artifact payloads are rewritten through
`mediaProxyUrl`. Aborting a turn also posts to the run's `cancel_url`.

When `transport` is omitted or set to `chat-sse`, the compatibility parser
accepts the original line protocol:

| Legacy line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"…"}}]}` | assistant text |
| `data: [DONE]` | turn complete |
| `intermediate_data: {…}` | tool/skill step (`parent_id` nests it) |
| `artifact_data: {…}` | validated artifact delivered to `onAnswer`, not rendered as prose |
| `error_data: {…}` | turn-level failure |
| `interaction_data: {…}` | unsupported-interaction error |
| `: keepalive` | ignored |

`artifact_data` carries the same `{version, kind, payload}` frame as the agent
API's `artifact.created`, is validated the same way, and gets the same
`mediaProxyUrl` rewriting. Any `vss.*` kind travels; which tab acts on one is
decided by that tab's answer handler, so a new kind needs no transport change.
Without this frame an agent answering in prose leaves the feature tabs empty,
and embedding the payload in the reply text costs tokens and invites truncated
or invented fields.

Legacy content is also read from `choices[0].message.content` and the plain
`value` / `output` / `answer` fields because agent servers differ.

## Tests

`npm test` runs two Jest projects: `logic` (node, no DOM) for the parsers,
import/export and markdown repairs, and `components` (jsdom) which drives
`ChatPanel` against a faked SSE stream.
