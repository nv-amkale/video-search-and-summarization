# vss-rt-cv — SBSA (Grace/DGX-Spark aarch64) image.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE FILE, and not another branch in docker/Dockerfile:
#   SBSA is linux/arm64 — the SAME TARGETARCH buildx reports for Jetson. buildx
#   offers no way to tell the two apart, so the multiarch file cannot select
#   between them. They also need different base images. Hence two files, one
#   image each, published under the same repo with an `-sbsa` tag suffix.
#
# Everything except the four points below is deliberately identical to
# docker/Dockerfile; keep them in sync when either changes.
#
#   1. Base image      — the SBSA DeepStream build, not the multiarch one.
#   2. prebuilts/sbsa  — SBSA-specific libmsda_fp16 / infercustomparser.
#                        The GDINO plugins are NOT SBSA-specific: SBSA reuses
#                        the _arm64 ones, matching ds9.1's sbsa.Dockerfile.
#   3. pip set         — open-clip-torch WITH deps (Jetson arm64 uses --no-deps)
#                        and CPU onnxruntime (no onnxruntime-gpu arm64 wheel).
#   4. nvidia-dali     — uninstalled after install_dependencies.sh, which pulls
#                        it in. SBSA only.
#
# LAYER ORDER IS COPIED VERBATIM FROM ds9.1 sbsa.Dockerfile AND IS LOAD-BEARING.
# The multiarch file hoists install_dependencies.sh to the front so that ~50 min
# layer stays cached. That reordering is NOT applied here: on SBSA the dali
# uninstall must follow install_dependencies.sh, and the interaction between
# that script and the pip set above it has not been verified under reordering.
# Layers are split for cacheability, which preserves execution order; the
# sequence itself is untouched.

    # Drop metadata directories Python cannot read. A pinned package that a
    # later resolve upgrades leaves its old <name>-<ver>.dist-info behind
    # holding only REQUESTED, with no METADATA. numpy is the live case:
    # numpy==1.26.4 is pinned above, then ml_dtypes (unpinned, pulled in by
    # onnx) raised its floor to numpy>=2.0.0 in 0.6.0, so pip upgrades numpy
